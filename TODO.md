[] implement intellisense (refer Haskero)
    - the intellisense should show every possible function for a type
    - For example, if I type `1.`, a list of functions that takes `int` as any parameter should show up


- each function decl should be assign a uniq UID, to ease transpilation

- error reporting does not contain accurate location

- define factorial function

- js ffi

- problem: cannot map JS boolean to Keli boolean

- should check for duplciated IDS first before going into analyzing
